# Data Science Capstone Project
Our final project for Data &amp; Society, exploring racial and ethnic representation within postsecondary education.

This dataset combines public data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System and the US Census Bureau’s American Community Service in an index of racial and ethnic representativeness of US postsecondary education institutions. The data set is originally sourced from Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System and US Census American Community Survey and was developed at the Urban Institute—made available under the ODC-BY 1.0 Attribution License. There are two data sets that are based on 4 years and 2 years college representativeness. 4-year college representativeness contains 34 variables and the 2-year college representativeness contains 30 variables.
