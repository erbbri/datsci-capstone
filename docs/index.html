        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This dataset combines public data from the Integrated 
            Postsecondary Education Data System and the 
            US Census Bureau’s American Community Service 
            in an index of racial and ethnic representativeness 
            of US postsecondary education institutions. The data set 
            is originally sourced from Integrated Postsecondary
             Education Data System and US Census American Community 
             Survey and was developed at the Urban Institute—made 
             available under the ODC-BY 1.0 Attribution License. 
             There are two data sets that are based on 4 years and 
             2 years college representativeness. 4-year college 
             representativeness contains 34 variables and the 2-year 
             college representativeness contains 30 variables.
            <br>
            <br>
            The key variables are the "dif_" variables, which show the 
            representativeness for each racial category (white, black, 
            hispanic, asian, pacific islander, native american, mixed) 
            with a numerical value determined by subtracting a school's
             percent enrollment of a certain racial group by the percent 
             of this group in a school's respective market. The market 
             was determined by the dividing the schools into urbanicity 
             categories (urban, suburban, rural) and determining how far 
             students travel to reach the school. Market distances 
             differed between both 2 and 4 year college groups and 
             urbanicity groups between these. Age also determined the 
             markets. Four year colleges looks at 18-24 year olds in a 
             121 mile radius for urban schools, 131 mile radius for 
             suburban schools, and 181 mile radius for rural schools. 
             Two year colleges look at 18-54 year olds in a 15 mile 
             radius for urban schools, 31 mile radius for suburban 
             schools, and a 34 mile radius for rural schools.
            <br>
            <br>
            Variables in the data set include categorical variables for 
            each school's id, year, FIPS code, name, two or four year 
            category, public or private status, for profit status, and 
            selectivity categorization per the Carnegie classifications 
            of non-selective, selective, and more selective. Quantitative
             variables in the set include total enrollment at each 
             school, percent enrollment at each college of each racial 
             group ("mcol_" variables), market percent for each racial 
             group ("mkt_" variables), and the previously mentioned 
             "dif_" variables for each group is the market percent minus the
            percent enrollment</p>

        <h4>Our Research Question:</h4>
        <p><b>"What do colleges who are closing the racial overrepresentation and underrepresentation gaps at a quicker rate 
            (2009-2017) have in common as opposed to others with constant or increasing gaps?"</b></p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        We initially sought to determine the schools that are most rapidly closing representation gaps through using our own mathematical metric from one of six options:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Line of best fit using sum of difference magnitudes and compare slopes.</b></li>
            <li>Line of best fit using mean of squared differences and compare slopes.</li>
            <li>Establish an ideal line for ideal comparison using sum of difference magnitudes and a quadratic line type and perform regression analysis.</li>
            <li>Establish an ideal line for ideal comparison using sum of difference magnitudes and an exponential line type and perform regression analysis.</li>
            <li>Establish an ideal line for ideal comparison using mean of squared differences and a quadratic line type and perform regression analysis.</li>
            <li>Establish an ideal line for ideal comparison using mean of squared differences and an exponential line type and perform regression analysis.</li>
        </ol>
        Once the top schools are determined, we paired our existing data data set with more variables from the Education Data Explorer 
        API including data on instituion types and categories, cost and aid for tuition and room and board, 
        family and student income, relgious afiliation, and other variables relating to the school
        Begin performing correlation analyses across schools to see which common variables may be contributing to 
        their push towards better representativeness. We then would use our finding to select variables to make a multiple regression 
        predictive model.
