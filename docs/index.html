        <h1>Racial and Ethnic Representativeness of U.S. Postsecondary Education Institutions</h1>
        <p>A project by Emily Bogle, Keaton Strawn, Sagma Prajapati, and Bridget Erb</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This dataset combines public data from the Integrated 
            Postsecondary Education Data System and the 
            US Census Bureau’s American Community Service 
            in an index of racial and ethnic representativeness 
            of US postsecondary education institutions. The data set 
            is originally sourced from Integrated Postsecondary
             Education Data System and US Census American Community 
             Survey and was developed at the Urban Institute—made 
             available under the ODC-BY 1.0 Attribution License. 
             There are two data sets that are based on 4 years and 
             2 years college representativeness. 4-year college 
             representativeness contains 34 variables and the 2-year 
             college representativeness contains 30 variables.
            <br>
            <br>
            The key variables are the "dif_" variables, which show the 
            representativeness for each racial category (white, black, 
            hispanic, asian, pacific islander, native american, mixed) 
            with a numerical value determined by subtracting a school's
             percent enrollment of a certain racial group by the percent 
             of this group in a school's respective market. The market 
             was determined by the dividing the schools into urbanicity 
             categories (urban, suburban, rural) and determining how far 
             students travel to reach the school. Market distances 
             differed between both 2 and 4 year college groups and 
             urbanicity groups between these. Age also determined the 
             markets. Four year colleges looks at 18-24 year olds in a 
             121 mile radius for urban schools, 131 mile radius for 
             suburban schools, and 181 mile radius for rural schools. 
             Two year colleges look at 18-54 year olds in a 15 mile 
             radius for urban schools, 31 mile radius for suburban 
             schools, and a 34 mile radius for rural schools.
            <br>
            <br>
            Variables in the data set include categorical variables for 
            each school's id, year, FIPS code, name, two or four year 
            category, public or private status, for profit status, and 
            selectivity categorization per the Carnegie classifications 
            of non-selective, selective, and more selective. Quantitative
             variables in the set include total enrollment at each 
             school, percent enrollment at each college of each racial 
             group ("mcol_" variables), market percent for each racial 
             group ("mkt_" variables), and the previously mentioned 
             "dif_" variables for each group is the market percent minus the
            percent enrollment.</p>

        <h4>Our Research Question:</h4>
        <p><b>"What do colleges who are closing the racial overrepresentation and underrepresentation gaps at a quicker rate 
            (2009-2017) have in common as opposed to others with constant or increasing gaps?"</b></p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        We initially sought to determine the schools that are most rapidly closing representation gaps through using our own mathematical metric from one of six options:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Line of best fit using sum of difference magnitudes and compare slopes.</b></li>
            <li>Line of best fit using mean of squared differences and compare slopes.</li>
            <li>Establish an ideal line for ideal comparison using sum of difference magnitudes and a quadratic line type and perform regression analysis.</li>
            <li>Establish an ideal line for ideal comparison using sum of difference magnitudes and an exponential line type and perform regression analysis.</li>
            <li>Establish an ideal line for ideal comparison using mean of squared differences and a quadratic line type and perform regression analysis.</li>
            <li>Establish an ideal line for ideal comparison using mean of squared differences and an exponential line type and perform regression analysis.</li>
        </ol>
        Once the top schools are determined, we paired our existing data data set with more variables from the Education Data Explorer 
        API including data on instituion types and categories, cost and aid for tuition and room and board, 
        family and student income, relgious afiliation, and other variables relating to the school. We then
        began performing correlation analyses across schools to see which common variables may be contributing to 
        their push towards better representativeness. After this, we would use our finding to select variables to make a multiple regression 
        predictive model to see if we could determine what schools would close that gap the fastest in later years.
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2>Modeling</h2>
        <p>In the hopes of creating more accurate multiple linear regression models, 
        we wanted to see if there were any other variables not included within our dataset that would 
        be useful in predicting what factors led to some schools closing their gap faster than other schools. 
        We included data on additional variables relating to institutional characteristics, funding, costs and 
        fees, and money distributed by schools was obtained through the 'educationdata' package in R, making 
        calls to the Urban Institute's Education Data Explorer API. This resulted in 30 additional variables 
        to the ones we previously had. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately, upon joining the datasets together we noticed quite a bit of missing data for a 
        lot of the added variables. Many values missing for certain schools, and some whole years or spans of 
        years missing. Our solution to this problem was to average across years to make a final set with one 
        row for each school, but this still yielded quite a bit of missing data which proved to be a problem 
        for us when it came time to make our models. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our hopes for these models were to get at least an R^2 value of 10%. We expected that we would have 
        to do quite a bit of transformation of the variables to get a linear correlation, and then we could 
        run ANOVA tests to determine which groups of data were statistically significant. But as stated before, 
        the problems that we ran into when trying to accomplish this goal were largely due to missing data. But 
        removing any of them would result in removing 54% of our data. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For our qualitative variables, we did not see any significant correlations and none of the graphs 
        produced from trying to predict the rank of a school showed linearity. We had a bit more luck with 
        some of the categorical variables we added, but it still yielded a very low R^2. Our final model to 
        predict rank used the variables used the private and selective variables, results for this model were 
        as follows:

        <br>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
        Our results from our model indicated that post-secondary institutions classified as private tended to 
        have higher rankings, while more selective institutions tended to have lower rankings. While we do believe 
        our findings are significant, we also acknowledge that there are quite a few flaws in our methodology.
        <br>
        <br>
        The biggest concern we have is with our missing data. We are only measuring MD rankings each year back to 
        2009 to 2017, so we have a very limited pool of data points to measure the rate at which each school is closing 
        its gap. This unfortunately could not be helped, and we do wish we had more data from previous and later years to 
        see more accurate trends.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another problem we ran into was with the definition of Market Percent. In the Urban Institute report, they determined 
        this by taking the radius surrounding the institution using the 75th percentile of the distribution. However, this 
        radius did not expand across state lines, making schools like Princeton in New Jersey pull from a smaller pool to define 
        their Market Percent. This also does not account for how many schools pull in students from out of state. However, it 
        proved extremely difficult to come up with a better way of defining Market Percent, as each school is unique in its approach
         to student recruitment. There is no monolithic way to define the Market, so we decided to use the metric we already had.
